# Instructions

To prepare for the written exam, please follow these steps:

Select the database you wish to work with (Asta, Azienda, or Ospedale).
In the "Populating" folder, you will find one or more SQL scripts. Execute these scripts to populate the database with sample data.
In the "Query" folder, you will find a series of files containing exercises. Open these files and write the necessary SQL queries to solve each exercise.
After completing an exercise, compare your solution with the one provided in the "Solutions" folder.
Continue working on the exercises until you feel confident with the concepts and SQL queries required.
# Notes

Make sure you have an appropriate development environment to execute SQL scripts and write queries. You can use a relational database management system such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.
Feel free to explore the sample databases to understand their structures and the relationships between tables before attempting the exercises.
Don't hesitate to consult SQL documentation or other online resources to deepen your understanding of any concepts that are not clear to you.
Experiment with different queries and challenge yourself by solving additional questions or problems related to the course material.
Best of luck with your preparation for the "Basi di Dati" course written exam!
